# Discount App

# About The App

## Start Screen
This is the first screen of the application which contains following input fields:
• Original Price
• Discount Percentage
As soon as user type the Original Price or Discount Percentage, following will be calculated and
shown on the screen:
• You Save
• Final Price

## Save the calculation
This feature is not present in most of the apps available on App Stores. Sometimes, we move around
during shopping and want to come back and see the after-discount price again of the item, to avoid
typing again the required inputs, we want to maintain a history of the calculations we performed.
In this App, we save the calculations with the save button. Button should remain disabled when any
of the input fields are empty. It should enable when user inputs the data. 
To avoid multiple save of same calculation, we should disable the Save button when user presses the
button and enable again when user changes values in the text fields.

## View History Screen
History Screen should contain a list of calculations performed. following information can be
displayed as single list item:
• Original Price
• Discount Percentage
• Price After Discount
History could show something like this
Original Price – Discount = Final Price
5000           – 25%      = 4000
4000           – 10%      = 3600
1000           – 10%      = 900

## Delete Item
There is an option to delete an item from a History Screen

## Clear History
A button on the top right corner of the header on History Screen should clear the list. Ask user
before clearing the history
